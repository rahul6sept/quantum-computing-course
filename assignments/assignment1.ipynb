    "We have seen the phase-shift operation $R_{\\phi}$ corresponding to rotation by some angle $\\phi$ about the $z$-axis. The statevector on the Bloch sphere traces a horizontal circle (a line of latitude) by $\\phi$  radians. This operation has the matrix representation\n",

    "It stands to reason that there are operations which rotate a vector about other axes too. We have already seen that the phase-shift gate is a generalisation of the Pauli $Z$ gate. So it is reasonable to think that rotation about the $x$-axis and $y$-axis might be related to the Pauli $X$ and $Y$ operations. This is indeed the case. In general a rotation about a Pauli axis (these are synonymous with the $x$, $y$ and $z$ axes for our purposes) is represented by $$R_{P}(\\theta) = \\exp(-i\\theta P/2) = \\cos(\\theta/2)I -i \\sin(\\theta/2)P$$\n",

    "##  Measurement in different bases\n",
    "Qiskit allows measurement only in the computational basis directly. However, we can also perform meaurements in other bases. \n",
    "For example, consider the Hadamard basis $\\{|+\\rangle, |-\\rangle\\}$. When we measure in this basis, we get an outcome that is one of the two basis vectors. This can be done by projecting a general state $|\\psi\\rangle$ onto each of the basis states $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$. The probability of obtaining the $+$ outcome is $ P_{+}(|\\psi\\rangle) = |\\langle +|\\psi\\rangle |^{2}$ and similarly for $-$. We note here that $|+\\rangle = H|0\\rangle$. Taking the adoint of this equation, we get $\\langle +| = \\langle 0|H^{\\dagger} = \\langle 0|H$ where we have used the fact that the Hadamard transformation is equal to it's adjoint (easily verified from the matrix representation). So we can write $ P_{+}(|\\psi\\rangle) = |\\langle +|\\psi\\rangle |^{2} =  |\\langle 0| H\\psi\\rangle |^{2}$. It seems that the probability of measuring the $+$ outcome in the Hadamard basis is the same as the probability of measuring $0$ in the computational basis after applying the Hadamard transformation to the statevector $|\\psi\\rangle$. So, if we want to measure in the Hadamard basis, we need only to add a Hadamard gate to our qubit and measure in the computational basis. \n",

    "To simulate the action of a polariser on plane-polarised light, we have to somehow map the problem onto the Bloch sphere. Here is one way to do it. As shown in the video, the light exiting the first polariser is plane-polarised, which means it is polarised in a plane at some angle to the horizontal and vertical axes. After that, the second polariser essentially _projects_ this onto the pass-axis orientation of the polariser, which can be seen as a kind of measurement. So in our quantum circuit, we will consider only this part of the experiment, and see what fraction of the plane polarised light is transmitted through the second polariser as a function of their relative orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to consider only plane-polarised light. Let us assume that the light exiting the first polarizer is horizontally polarised. We know that if we place the second polariser with it's pass-axis vertical, no light will be transmitted. So these two states are orthogonal. Let us map these two states to $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ respectively (since these are also orthogonal). However, note that while the angle between the two orthogonal polarisation states is $\\pi/2$, the angle on the Bloch sphere between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ is $\\pi$. We know that any other orientation of linearly polarised light can be written as a superposition of these two basis vectors. Moreover, since we are only considering linearly polarised light, we know that the relative phase is $0$. So we can restrict ourselves to the great circle on the Bloch sphere passing through $|0\\rangle$, $|+\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$. \n",
    "## **Problem 2**\n",
    "For this experiment, we will need to create a parameterised circuit, where the rotation angle is a parameter. Qiskit enables this using `Parameter()`. We will define a parameter $\\beta$ which is the relative angle between the two polarisers. Given below is a quantum circuit where the qubit starts in the $|0\\rangle$ state, the equivalent of horizontally plane polarised light. Change the measurement basis using a rotation gate with an angle of rotation in terms of the variable `beta` and measure in this basis. This basis change should correspond to rotating the second polariser by an angle $\\beta$. We take $\\beta$ to be positive in the counter-clockwise direction. "
